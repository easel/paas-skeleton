# Set the default makefile target. this line must remain the first line in the makefile
# in order to maintain precedence. It should also always contain "check-paas-skeleton-env" as
# a dependency in order to ensure that things always run in the correct environment.
#
# You can add other targets here as you wish, such as "check-python-virtualenv" to ensure the
# python virtualenv is configured and up to date.
default: check-paas-skeleton-env check-python-virtualenv

# Clean target. Add additional things to clean to this list.
clean: clean-python-virtualenv
